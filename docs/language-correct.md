You don’t want any fake “soft restarts” or mid-session layout flipping.
You want the clean, user-friendly approach that every polished app does: 1. User changes language (English ↔ Arabic). 2. App saves preference (language + RTL flag) to persistent storage. 3. App shows a clear modal or toast:
“Please restart the app to apply the new language and layout.” 4. User closes the app manually and reopens. 5. On startup, the app applies both language + layout before first render, so everything is consistent.

⸻

Why this works better
• No crashes from forcing RTL on the fly.
• No scattered UI (half-updated text, wrong layout).
• Predictable UX — users know exactly what to expect.
• Apple & React Native–friendly — RTL is designed to be applied only on launch.

Implementation plan

1. Store language + RTL preference

Use MMKV (fast, synchronous):

import { I18nManager } from 'react-native';
import { storage } from './mmkv';

export function saveLanguagePreference(lang: 'en' | 'ar') {
storage.set('language', lang);
storage.set('isRTL', lang === 'ar');
}

⸻

2. Apply settings at startup

In your root App.tsx before rendering anything:

import { I18nManager } from 'react-native';
import { storage } from './mmkv';

const lang = storage.getString('language') || 'en';
const isRTL = lang === 'ar';

// Only force if it doesn't match current
if (I18nManager.isRTL !== isRTL) {
I18nManager.forceRTL(isRTL);
I18nManager.allowRTL(isRTL);
}

This ensures layout direction is correct before React renders the first frame.

3. Show a restart-required modal

When user toggles language:

import { Alert } from 'react-native';

function onLanguageChange(lang: 'en' | 'ar') {
saveLanguagePreference(lang);

Alert.alert(
"Restart Required",
"Please restart the app to apply the new language and layout.",
[{ text: "OK" }]
);
}

⸻

4. Benefits of this method
   • No runtime RTL switching
   • No reload commands (Expo Updates, react-native-restart) needed
   • Works 100% offline, no extra libraries for restart
   • Matches the exact flow of WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, etc. when switching between LTR/RTL

⸻

This way, the app doesn’t even try to update layout or translations mid-session — it just tells the user to restart, and on launch it loads the correct setup.

⸻

If you want, I can give you a full Expo + NativeWind–ready language toggle system that does this with zero mid-session issues.
Would you like me to prepare that?
