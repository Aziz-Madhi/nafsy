# Security Audit Report - Nafsy Mental Health App

**Date:** January 17, 2025  
**Auditor:** Senior Security Developer Review  
**Application:** Nafsy - Mental Health React Native App  
**Tech Stack:** React Native (Expo), Convex (Backend), Clerk (Authentication)

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive security audit evaluates the authentication implementation of the Nafsy mental health application. The review covers frontend authentication flows, backend security controls, data protection mechanisms, and overall security posture.

**Overall Security Grade: B+ (Good with Minor Improvements Needed)**

The application demonstrates solid security practices with proper authentication provider integration, multi-layered authentication guards, and encrypted storage. However, there are areas for improvement in rate limiting, input validation, and security monitoring.

## 1. Authentication Architecture Overview

### Strengths ‚úÖ

1. **Third-Party Authentication Provider (Clerk)**
   - Delegating authentication to a specialized provider (Clerk) reduces implementation complexity and security risks
   - Proper integration with Convex backend through ConvexProviderWithClerk
   - Token-based authentication with JWT handling by Clerk

2. **Multi-Layer Authentication Guards**
   - Root level auth check in `src/app/_layout.tsx:73`
   - Protected route guards in `src/app/(app)/_layout.tsx:16`
   - Tab-level authentication in `src/app/(app)/tabs/_layout.tsx:17`
   - Redundant checks provide defense in depth

3. **Proper Session Management**
   - Session creation and management handled by Clerk
   - Automatic redirection based on authentication state
   - Clean separation between authenticated and public routes

### Areas of Concern ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Fallback Key Generation**
   - `src/lib/secure-key.ts:61-70` - The fallback key generation is weak
   - Uses `Math.random()` which is not cryptographically secure
   - Should use Crypto.getRandomValues() or similar

## 2. Frontend Security Analysis

### Strengths ‚úÖ

1. **Input Validation**
   - Email format validation with regex (`src/hooks/useAuthForm.ts:77`)
   - Password minimum length requirement (8 characters)
   - Name field validation for signup
   - Real-time validation feedback to users

2. **Error Handling**
   - Proper error messages without exposing sensitive information
   - User-friendly error alerts
   - Error shake animation for better UX

3. **Email Verification Flow**
   - Two-step signup process with email verification
   - 6-digit verification code implementation
   - Prevents unverified account access

### Security Issues Found üî¥

1. **Weak Password Requirements**
   - Only 8-character minimum length (`src/hooks/useAuthForm.ts:79`)
   - No complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
   - No password strength indicator
   - **Recommendation:** Implement stronger password policy with complexity requirements

2. **Email Normalization**
   - Email is converted to lowercase (`src/hooks/useAuthForm.ts:125,153`)
   - Good practice but should also trim whitespace consistently

3. **Missing CAPTCHA/Bot Protection**
   - No CAPTCHA or rate limiting on authentication forms
   - Vulnerable to automated attacks and credential stuffing
   - **Recommendation:** Implement reCAPTCHA or similar bot protection

## 3. Backend Security Analysis

### Strengths ‚úÖ

1. **Authentication Utilities**
   - Centralized authentication checks in `convex/authUtils.ts`
   - Consistent user verification across all endpoints
   - Proper error handling with custom error types

2. **Rate Limiting Implementation**
   - Basic rate limiting in `convex/errorUtils.ts:125-152`
   - Per-operation rate limits (`authUtils.ts:106`)
   - 100 requests per minute default limit

3. **Authorization Controls**
   - User access validation (`authUtils.ts:39-51`)
   - Prevents cross-user data access
   - Every Convex function validates authentication

### Security Issues Found üî¥

1. **In-Memory Rate Limiting**
   - Rate limit store uses in-memory Map (`errorUtils.ts:123`)
   - **Issue:** Resets on server restart, not distributed across instances
   - **Recommendation:** Use Redis or database-backed rate limiting

2. **Missing User Creation Validation**
   - `convex/users.ts:createUser` doesn't validate Clerk ID format
   - No verification that the caller is authorized to create the user
   - **Recommendation:** Add webhook signature verification for Clerk events

3. **Error Information Disclosure**
   - Development mode logs full error details (`errorUtils.ts:78`)
   - Should ensure NODE_ENV is properly set in production

## 4. Data Protection & Storage

### Strengths ‚úÖ

1. **MMKV Encryption**
   - Storage encrypted with device-specific keys (`src/lib/mmkv-storage.ts`)
   - Uses expo-secure-store for key management
   - Fallback to unencrypted storage with warning

2. **Secure Key Management**
   - Keys stored in device keychain/keystore (`src/lib/secure-key.ts`)
   - Cryptographically secure key generation with expo-crypto
   - 256-bit encryption keys

3. **Token Management**
   - Clerk handles token storage securely
   - Uses tokenCache from @clerk/clerk-expo
   - No tokens found hardcoded in source

### Security Issues Found üî¥

1. **Weak Fallback Key**
   - `getFallbackKey()` uses Math.random() (`secure-key.ts:66`)
   - Not cryptographically secure
   - **Recommendation:** Always use crypto.getRandomValues()

2. **Unencrypted Fallback Storage**
   - Falls back to unencrypted storage on error (`mmkv-storage.ts:32`)
   - Only logs warning, doesn't alert user
   - **Recommendation:** Fail securely - don't store sensitive data unencrypted

## 5. Configuration & Environment Security

### Strengths ‚úÖ

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Proper use of environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - .env files properly gitignored
   - No hardcoded secrets found in codebase

2. **Configuration Validation**
   - Throws errors for missing required configuration (`src/config/env.ts:31,37`)
   - Type-safe configuration interface
   - Separate handling for dev/prod environments

### Security Issues Found üî¥

1. **Missing Security Headers**
   - No Content Security Policy implementation
   - No certificate pinning for API calls
   - **Recommendation:** Implement security headers and certificate pinning

## 6. Session & Token Security

### Strengths ‚úÖ

1. **Clerk Token Management**
   - Secure token storage and refresh handled by Clerk
   - Proper session lifecycle management
   - Automatic token expiration handling

2. **Convex Integration**

   - User identity verification on each request
   - Session-based access control

### Security Issues Found üî¥

1. **No Session Timeout Configuration**
   - No explicit session timeout settings visible
   - No idle timeout implementation
   - **Recommendation:** Implement configurable session and idle timeouts

2. **Missing Token Rotation**
   - No evidence of refresh token rotation
   - **Recommendation:** Implement token rotation for enhanced security

## Conclusion

The Nafsy application demonstrates a solid foundation for authentication security with proper use of established authentication providers (Clerk) and backend services (Convex). The multi-layered authentication approach and encrypted storage show security consciousness in the design.

However, there are important areas for improvement:
- Password policy needs strengthening
- Rate limiting needs to be more robust
- Bot protection should be added
- Security monitoring needs implementation

Given the sensitive nature of mental health data, prioritizing these security improvements is crucial for protecting user privacy and maintaining trust.
