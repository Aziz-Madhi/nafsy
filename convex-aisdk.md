To configure Convex with the Convex AI SDK (AISDK) for chat, messaging, responses, and streaming in an Expo React Native app, you should follow these steps based on the available knowledge sources:

---

### 1. **Integrate Convex AI SDK (AISDK) for Chat and Streaming**

- **Server-side: Define chat and message logic using the SDK.**
  For streaming chat, you’ll use the `listMessages` and `syncStreams` helpers from the SDK. Here’s an example query for listing thread messages with streaming support:

  ```ts
  import { paginationOptsValidator } from 'convex/server';
  import { v, vStreamArgs, listMessages, syncStreams } from '@convex-dev/agent';
  import { components } from './_generated/api';

  export const listThreadMessages = query({
    args: {
      threadId: v.string(),
      paginationOpts: paginationOptsValidator,
      streamArgs: vStreamArgs,
    },
    handler: async (ctx, args) => {
      // ...authorization...
      const paginated = await listMessages(ctx, components.agent, args);
      const streams = await syncStreams(ctx, components.agent, args);
      return { ...paginated, streams };
    },
  });
  ```

  This enables both paginated and streaming retrieval of messages.

### 2. **Client-side: Display and Stream Messages**

- **Use the `useThreadMessages` hook for real-time streaming:**

  ```tsx
  import { api } from '../convex/_generated/api';
  import { useThreadMessages, toUIMessages } from '@convex-dev/agent/react';

  function MyComponent({ threadId }: { threadId: string }) {
    const messages = useThreadMessages(
      api.chat.streaming.listMessages,
      { threadId },
      { initialNumItems: 10, stream: true }
    );
    return (
      <View>
        {toUIMessages(messages.results ?? []).map((message) => (
          <Text key={message.key}>{message.text}</Text>
        ))}
      </View>
    );
  }
  ```

- **For smooth streaming text, use the `useSmoothText` hook:**
  ```tsx
  import { useSmoothText } from '@convex-dev/agent/react';
  const [visibleText] = useSmoothText(message.text, {
    startStreaming: message.status === 'streaming',
  });
  ```

### **Summary**

- **Backend:** Use Convex with the AI SDK to define chat/message storage and streaming logic.
- **Frontend:** Use the AI SDK’s React hooks (`useThreadMessages`, `useSmoothText`) to display and stream messages in real time in your Expo React Native app.

This setup provides a robust, real-time, streaming chat experience leveraging Convex’s reactivity and the AI SDK’s abstractions.

Great question! Writing every token or small chunk to the database can indeed lead to increased bandwidth usage and higher costs, especially in a streaming chat scenario. However, Convex and its components are designed to address this concern:

- **Persistent Text Streaming Component:**  
  This component is specifically built to balance HTTP streaming (for immediate, character-by-character updates to the originating client) with efficient database persistence. Instead of writing every token to the database, it batches updates—typically at sentence or paragraph boundaries—before persisting them. This reduces redundant writes and bandwidth usage, while still providing a responsive experience for all users. Other clients (or tabs) receive updates in these larger, more efficient chunks, not every single token, which helps control costs and database load.

  > "The message is only updated in the database on sentence boundaries, whereas the HTTP stream sends tokens as they come... If you write every single small chunk to the database, this will get quite slow and expensive. But if you batch up the chunks into, say, paragraphs, then the user experience will feel laggy. This component combines the best of both worlds."

- **AI SDK Streaming Options:**  
  When using the AI SDK, you can configure how often deltas (chunks) are saved to the database using options like `chunking` (by word, line, regex, or custom function) and `throttleMs` (how frequently to write). This allows you to tune the tradeoff between interactivity and cost efficiency.
  > "You can pass more options to saveStreamDeltas to configure the chunking and debouncing... throttleMs is how frequently the deltas are saved. This will send multiple chunks per delta, writes sequentially, and will not write faster than the throttleMs."  
  > [Agents > Messages > Streaming](https://docs.convex.dev/agents/messages#streaming)

**In summary:**  
Convex provides built-in mechanisms (via components and SDK options) to avoid excessive database writes and bandwidth usage, making streaming chat both responsive and cost-efficient. You do not need to handle this batching logic manually—just use the provided configuration options or components for optimal results.
