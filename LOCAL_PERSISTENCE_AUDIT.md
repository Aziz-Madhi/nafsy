# Local Persistence Implementation Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the local persistence implementation in the Nafsy mental health app. The implementation uses SQLite for offline data storage with a sync manager for bidirectional synchronization with Convex backend.

### Current Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Implemented and Working:**

- Mood tracking persistence (SQLite + sync)
- Exercise catalog persistence (SQLite + sync)
- User progress tracking persistence (SQLite + sync)
- Network monitoring and offline detection
- Outbox pattern for pending operations
- Failed operations queue (DLQ)
- Incremental sync with cursors
- UI indicators for offline status

‚ùå **Not Implemented:**

- Chat messages persistence
- Chat sessions persistence
- User profile data persistence

‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Implemented:**

- Sync conflict resolution (basic implementation, could be improved)

## Architecture Overview

### 1. SQLite Foundation (`src/lib/local-first/sqlite.ts`)

**Strengths:**

- Proper database initialization with WAL mode for better performance
- Migration system in place for schema evolution
- Event-driven updates using a simple listener pattern
- Proper indexes for query optimization
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Transaction support for atomic operations

**Key Components:**

- **Database Tables:**
  - `mood_entries` - Stores mood data with server sync tracking
  - `exercises` - Cached exercise catalog from server
  - `exercise_logs` - User progress/completion records
  - `outbox_ops` - Pending operations to sync to server
  - `failed_ops` - Dead letter queue for failed operations
  - `sync_state` - Stores sync cursors for incremental sync

**Issues Found:**

1. **No Chat Tables:** Chat messages and sessions have no SQLite persistence
2. **Transaction Conflicts:** Some import operations avoid transactions to prevent conflicts, which could lead to partial imports on failure
3. **Limited Error Recovery:** Failed operations go to DLQ but no automatic retry mechanism after network recovery

### 2. Sync Manager (`src/lib/offline/sync-manager.ts`)

**Strengths:**

- Network state monitoring with automatic sync on reconnection
- Configurable sync intervals and retry logic
- Bidirectional sync (push local changes, pull server updates)
- Incremental sync using watermarks/cursors
- Operation acknowledgment pattern

**Implementation Details:**

- **Push Operations:** Reads from outbox, sends to Convex, acknowledges on success
- **Pull Operations:** Fetches server updates since last sync cursor
- **Conflict Resolution:** Server-wins strategy (server data overwrites local on conflict)

**Issues Found:**

1. **No Chat Sync:** Sync manager only handles moods, exercises, and progress
2. **Limited Conflict Resolution:** Always favors server data, no merge strategies
3. **No Offline Queue Management UI:** Users can't see or manage pending operations

### 3. Offline Hooks (`src/hooks/useOfflineData.ts`)

**Strengths:**

- Clean abstraction over SQLite and Convex
- Seamless fallback between online/offline data
- Event-driven UI updates when local data changes
- Proper debouncing of server imports

**Implemented Hooks:**

- `useOfflineMoodData` - Fetches mood entries with offline support
- `useOfflineTodayMood` - Today's mood with offline support
- `useOfflineMoodStats` - Mood statistics calculation
- `useOfflineCreateMood` - Creates mood locally and syncs when online
- `useOfflineExercisesWithProgress` - Exercise list with completion status
- `useOfflineUserStats` - User progress statistics
- `useOfflineRecordProgress` - Records exercise completion

**Missing Hooks:**

- No offline chat hooks
- No offline user profile hooks

### 4. UI Integration

**Well Integrated:**

- **Mood Screen** (`src/app/(app)/tabs/mood/index.tsx`) - Uses all offline hooks correctly
- **Exercise Screen** (`src/app/(app)/tabs/exercises/index.tsx`) - Properly uses offline hooks
- **Offline Indicator** (`src/components/ui/OfflineIndicator.tsx`) - Shows sync status clearly

**Not Integrated:**

- **Chat Screen** (`src/app/(app)/tabs/chat.tsx`) - Direct Convex queries, no offline support
- **Settings Screen** - No offline consideration for user preferences

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Chat Persistence (High Priority)

**Impact:** Chat history completely disappears when offline
**Solution Required:**

- Add chat tables to SQLite schema
- Implement chat sync in sync manager
- Create offline chat hooks
- Update chat UI to use offline hooks

### 2. Transaction Management Issues (Medium Priority)

**Impact:** Risk of partial data imports on failure
**Current Code (lines 413-458 in sqlite.ts):**

```typescript
// Avoid starting a transaction here to prevent nested/parallel
// transaction conflicts when multiple imports run concurrently.
for (const m of serverMoods) {
  // Direct SQL operations without transaction
}
```

**Solution:** Implement proper transaction batching or queue imports sequentially

### 3. No Automatic Retry for Failed Operations (Medium Priority)

**Impact:** Failed operations stay in DLQ indefinitely
**Solution:** Add exponential backoff retry mechanism for failed operations

### 4. Limited Conflict Resolution (Low Priority)

**Impact:** Local changes can be lost if server has different data
**Solution:** Implement more sophisticated merge strategies

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Implement Chat Persistence:**

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE chat_messages (
     id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
     server_id TEXT,
     session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
     user_id TEXT,
     content TEXT NOT NULL,
     role TEXT NOT NULL,
     created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
     updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
     deleted INTEGER DEFAULT 0
   );

   CREATE TABLE chat_sessions (
     id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
     server_id TEXT,
     user_id TEXT,
     title TEXT,
     type TEXT,
     started_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
     last_message_at INTEGER,
     updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
     deleted INTEGER DEFAULT 0
   );
   ```

2. **Add Chat Sync to Manager:**
   - Implement `syncChatMessages()` method
   - Implement `syncChatSessions()` method
   - Add chat to sync cycle

3. **Create Chat Offline Hooks:**
   - `useOfflineChatMessages(sessionId)`
   - `useOfflineChatSessions()`
   - `useOfflineCreateMessage()`

### Short-term Improvements (Priority 2)

1. **Fix Transaction Management:**
   - Implement import queue to serialize database writes
   - Use larger transactions with proper error handling

2. **Add Retry Mechanism:**
   - Implement exponential backoff for failed operations
   - Add manual retry option in UI

3. **Improve Error Visibility:**
   - Show failed operations count in UI
   - Allow users to view and retry failed operations

### Long-term Enhancements (Priority 3)

1. **Enhanced Conflict Resolution:**
   - Implement field-level merge strategies
   - Add conflict UI for user resolution
   - Track operation timestamps for better ordering

2. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Add data compression for storage efficiency
   - Optimize sync batch sizes

3. **Advanced Features:**
   - Selective sync (user chooses what to sync)
   - Data export functionality
   - Offline analytics

## Testing Recommendations

### Critical Test Scenarios

1. **Offline to Online Transition:**
   - Create mood entries offline
   - Go online and verify sync
   - Check for duplicates

2. **Concurrent Operations:**
   - Create multiple entries rapidly
   - Verify all are synced correctly

3. **Conflict Scenarios:**
   - Modify same data on multiple devices
   - Verify conflict resolution

4. **Error Recovery:**
   - Simulate network failures during sync
   - Verify retry mechanism

5. **Data Integrity:**
   - Force close app during sync
   - Verify no data corruption

## Conclusion

The current local persistence implementation successfully handles mood tracking, exercises, and user progress with offline support. However, the **critical gap is the lack of chat persistence**, which significantly impacts user experience when offline.

The architecture is well-designed with proper separation of concerns, but needs the additions outlined above to fully meet the offline-first requirements. The sync manager and SQLite foundation are robust and can easily be extended to support chat and other features.

### Implementation Priority:

1. üî¥ **Critical:** Implement chat persistence (1-2 days)
2. üü° **Important:** Fix transaction management and add retry logic (1 day)
3. üü¢ **Nice to have:** Enhanced conflict resolution and performance optimizations (2-3 days)

Total estimated time for full implementation: **4-6 days**
