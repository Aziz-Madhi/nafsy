## 🏗️ Architecture Transformation

### Before Optimization:
```
❌ Monolithic 1,957-line over-engineered state system
❌ Duplicate animation code scattered across components
❌ Heavy initial bundle loading all features upfront  
❌ 13 scattered Convex functions with duplication
❌ Complex MMKV abstraction layers
❌ No performance monitoring or validation
```

### After Optimization:
```
✅ Clean 650-line maintainable state system (67% reduction)
✅ Unified animation system with standardized presets
✅ Lazy-loaded features with intelligent preloading
✅ 7 consolidated Convex functions with unified API
✅ Direct MMKV access with simple wrapper
✅ Comprehensive performance monitoring & validation
```
